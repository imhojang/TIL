## Discovering Swift 🦅

Today I found a web that where I can self analyze my swift skill with some interesting set of quizzes they have available. Here I have listed some Swift grammer insights, and questions that I got it wrong / want to review later.

```swift
enum CompassDirection: CaseIterable {
    case north, south, east, west
}

print("There are \(CompassDirection.allCases.count) directions.")
// Prints "There are 4 directions."
let caseList = CompassDirection.allCases
                               .map({ "\($0)" })
                               .joined(separator: ", ")
// caseList == "north, south, east, west"
```



#### CaseIterable

\[Protocol]

A type that provides a collection of all of its value

Types that conform to the `CaseIterable` protocol are typically enumerations without associated values. When using a `CaseIterable` type, you can access a collection of all of the type’s cases by using the type’s `allCases` property.

####  Answer Review 🙆🏻‍♀️🙅🏿‍♂️

Score : 11/20 😱

What output will be produced by the code below?

\#1 Initialization of Classes

```swift
class Starship {
    var type: String
    var age: Int
}

let serenity = Starship(type: "Firefly", age: 24)
print(serenity.type)
```

Question: What output will be produced by the code below?

My Answer: `"Firefly"`

Correct Answer: `This code will not compile`

Explanation: Struct have memberwise initialization as standard, but this is not available to classes. The code will fail to compile because the **Starship** class has no initializers.



\#2 Joining of the arrays

```swift
let first = ["Sulaco", "Nostromo"]
let second = ["X-Wing", "TIE Fighter"]
let third = first + second
```

Question: What output will be produced by the code below?

My Answer & Correct Answer : `["Sulaco", "Nostromo", "X-Wing", "TIE Fighter"]`

Explanation: Swift arrays can be joined together using the **+** operator, which adds the right-hand array to the end of the left-hand.



\#3

```swift
let oneMillion = 1_000_000
let oneThousand = oneMillion / 0_1_0_0_0
print(oneThousand)
```

Question: What output will be produced by the code below?

My Answer & Correct Answer: `1000`

Explanation: Swift allows you to **use any number of leading zeros before a number**, and **any number of underscores inside a number**, in order **to make reading easier**. The example given, 0_1_0_0_0, is unlikely, but a perfectly valid way to write 1000.



\#4 Default data type of a number with decimals

```swift
let i = 10.2
```

Question: Given the code above, what data type does `i` have?

My Answer: `Float`

Correct Answer: `Double`

Explanation: When given a floating-point number, Swift's type inference will use the **Double** data type.



\#5 Inheritance of classes: `Final` keyword

```swift
final class Dog {
    func bark() {
        print("Woof!")
    }
}

class Corgi : Dog {
    override func bark() {
        print("Yip!")
    }
}

let muttface = Corgi()
muttface.bark()
```

Question: What output will be produced by the code below?

My Answer: `"Woof!"`

Correct Answer: `The code will not compile`

Explanation: The `Dog` class is marked as `final`. This means that the class cannot be inherited from. Therefore, the class `Corgi` cannot inherit class `Dog`. 



\#7

```swift
var i = 2
do {
  print(i)
  i *= 2
} while (i < 128)
```

Question: What output will be produced by the code below?

My Answer: `2 4, 8, 16, 32, 64`

Correct Answer: `This code will not compile.`

Explanation: The `do` keyword is invalid here; should use `repeat` instead.



\#8 UInt

```swift
let num = UInt.min
```

Question: When this code is executed, what value will `num` have?

My Answer & Correct Answer : `0`

Explanation: `UInt` stands for `unsigned integer`, and indicates integer with zero and positive values, excluding negative values. Therefore, the minimum value of unsigned integer is zero.

\#9

```swift
for i in 3...1 {
  print(i)
}
```

Question: What output will be produced by the code below?

My Answer: `This code will not compile.`

Correct Answer: `This code will compile but crash.`

Explanation: This code will compile successfully, but crash at runtime. Swift does not allow you to generate ranges where the initial value is greater than the end value.

\#10

Which Swift compiler directive will force the compiler to issue an error?

- \#error
- @error
- !error
- _ERROR
- none

My Answer: `@error`

Correct Answer: `#error`

Explanation: The `#error` compiler directive forces Switch to issue an error. It's useful when you're sending code to someone and they need to fill in an important value, such as an API key.

\#11

```swift
let names = ["Amy", "Clara"]

for i in 0 ... names.length {
  print("Hello, \(names[i])!")
}
```

Question: What output will be produced by the code below?

My answer: `This code will compile but crash.`

Correct answer: `This code will not compile.`

Explanation: Swift arrays do not have a `length` property, this code should use `count`.

With that replacement, the code will compile, but will then crash becasue it uses the closed range operator (...), which will cause an **out-of-bounds error** when reading into the array.



\#12

```swift
enum Weather {
  case sunny
  case cloudy
  case windy(speed: Int)
}

let today: Weather = .windy(speed: 10)

switch today {
case .sunny, .cloudy: 
  print("It's not that windy")
case .windy(let speed) where speed >= 10:
  print("It's very windy")
default:
  print("It's a bit windy")
}
```

Question: What output will be produced by the code below?

My Answer & Correct Answer: `It's very windy`

Explanation: The `windy` case value has an associated value to store the wind speed as an integer. In the code, this is set to 10, which means the "It's very windy" case will be triggered in the `switch` block

\#13

```swift
let names = ["Chris", "Joe", "Doug", "Jordan"]

if let name = names[1] {
    print("Brought to you by \(name)")
}
```

Question: What output will be produced by the code below?

My Answer: `"Brought to you by Joe"`

Correct Answer: `This code will not compile`

Explanation: **Subscripting an array of strings will return a `String` rather than `String?`**, which means that it is a compile error to attempt to unwrap it using `if let`.

\#14

```swift
let names = ["Serenity", "Sulaco", "Enterprise", "Galactica"]

if let last = names.last {
  print(last)
}
```

Question: What output will be produced by the code below?

My Answer: `Optional("Galactica")`

Correct Answer: `"Galactica"`

Explanation: Using `names.last` will return an optional string, but the `if let` unwraps that safely to produce "Galactica".
