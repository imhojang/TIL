## Tools

- appium - test automation framework
  - Appium is an open source test automation framework for use with native, hybrid and mobile web apps. It drives iOS, Android and Windows apps using the WebDriver protocol.
- AutoIt - scripting language for automating Windows GUI and general scripting
  - AutoIt v3 is a freeware BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting. It uses a combination of simulated keystrokes, mouse movement and window/control manipulation in order to automate tasks in a way not possible or reliable with other languages
  - AutoIt was initially designed for PC “roll out” situations to reliably automate and configure thousands of PCs. Over time it has become a powerful language that supports complex expressions, user functions, loops and everything else that veteran scripters would expect.
- Codeception
  - Codeception is a multi-featured testing framework for PHP. It can handle unit, functional, and acceptance testing of web applications and it's powered by the already very popular PHPUnit testing framework.
  - Codeception allows us to test different kinds of user perspectives and site scenarios while they are visiting our app to ensure a pleasant user experience. By testing multiple scenarios, we can simulate a user's natural flow throughout our application to make sure the app is working as expected.
- Composer
  - dependency manager for PHP. just like npm for javascript.
- Grafana (그라파나)
  - Grafana is an open source solution for running data analytics, pulling up metrics that make sense of the massive amount of data & to monitor our apps with the help of cool customizable dashboards.
- K8s
  - Kubernetes is commonly stylized as k8s
  - An open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management.

- Openstack - cloudtookit
  - A set of software tools for building and managing cloud computing platforms for public and private clouds.
  - OpenStack lets users deploy virtual machines and other instances that handle different tasks for managing a cloud environment on the fly. It makes horizontal scaling easy, which means that tasks that benefit from running concurrently can easily serve more or fewer users on the fly by just spinning up more instances.

  - Windows 7 VM : 사용자 환경 기반의 브라우저 테스트 수행
  - Linux VM: Grid test 및 CI (sub Jenkins) 역할 수행
- RipsTech
- Selenium Web Driver
  - If you are beginning with desktop website or mobile website test automation, then you are going to be using WebDriver APIs. WebDriver uses browser automation APIs provided by browser vendors to control browser and run tests. This is as if a real user is operating the browser. Since WebDriver does not require its API to be compiled with application code, it is not intrusive. Hence, you are testing the same application which you push live.
- sikuli
  - Graphical User Interface automation tool
  - Sikuli automates anything you see on the screen using the image recognition method to identify GUI elements. Sikuli script allows users to automate GUI interaction by using screenshots.
- SonarLint
- SonarQube

- SVN
  - SubVersioN is one of many version control options. It's abbreviated as SVN.

## Technical Terminologies

- Acceptance Tests

  - How does your client, manager, tester, or any other non-technical person know your website is working? By opening the browser, accessing the site, clicking on links, filling in the forms, and actually seeing the content on a web page. They have no idea of the programming language, framework, database, web-server, or why the application did (or did not) behave as expected.
  - This is what acceptance tests are doing. They cover scenarios from a user's perspective. With acceptance tests, you can be confident that users, following all the defined scenarios, won't get errors.
    Any website can be covered with acceptance tests, even even if you use a very exotic CMS or framework.

- Driver (device driver)

  - device driver is a computer program that operates or controls a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. A driver provides a software interface to hardware devices, enabling operating systems and other computer programs to access hardware functions without needing to know precise details about the hardware being used.
  - A driver communicates with the device through the computer bus or communications subsystem to which the hardware connects. 

- Dynamic analysis (동적 테스트)

  - Analysis performed on programs while they are executing

- Grid Test

- Ingress

  - An API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP.
    Ingress may provide load balancing, SSL (secure sockets layer) termination and name-based virtual hosting.
  - https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#what-is-ingress

- Integration test (통합테스트, 통테)

  - A level of software testing where individual units are combined and tested as a group
  - The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units.

- Port Forwarding (포트 포워딩)

  - In computer networking, port forwarding or port mapping is an application of network address translation (NAT) that redirects a communication requests from one address and port number combination to another while the packets are traversing a network gateway, such as a router or firewall. 
  - This technique is most commonly used to make services on a host residing on a protected or masqueraded (internal) network available to hosts on the opposite side of the gateway (external network), by remapping the destination IP address and port number of the communication to an internal host.

- Pairwise Test

  - Pairwise Testing also known as All-pairs testing is a testing approach taken for testing the software using combinatorial method. It's a method to test all the possible discrete combinations of the parameters involved.
  - Assume we have a piece of software to be tested which has got 10 input fields and 10 possible settings for each input field, then there are 10^10 possible inputs to be tested. In this case, exhaustive testing is impossible if we wish to test all combinations
    

- Static Analysis (정적 테스트)

  - Analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs
  - In most cases the analysis is performed on some version of the source code, and in the other cases, some form of the object code.
  - The term is usually applied to the analysis performed by an automated tool, with human analysis being called program understanding, program comprehension, or code reivew. 

- SSL

  - Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client—typically a web server (website) and a browser, or a mail server and a mail client (e.g., Outlook).
  - https://www.digicert.com/ssl/

- TSL

  - Transport Layer Security, and its now-deprecated predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer, are cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security over a computer network. Several versions of the protocols find widespread use in applications such as web browsing, email, instant messaging, and voice over IP.
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security

- WebDriver

  - WebDriver is a web automation framework that allows you to execute your tests against different browsers, not just Firefox, Chrome (unlike Selenium IDE)
  - WebDriver also enables you to use a programming language in creating your test scripts (not possible in Selenium IDE)

  ## Other

- back-office software 

  - 회사에서 업무를 하기 위해 쓰이는 소프트웨어. 고객들이나 사용자한테는 보이지 않고, 회사의 매출과 직접적인 연관이 없음. 
  - back-office software is used to manage business operations that are not related to direct sales efforts and interfaces that are not seen by consumers.

- GCP

  - short for "google cloud platform"
  - in-house software - 회사가 회사 내부에서 쓰기 위해 만든 소프트웨어
  - in-house software is a software that is produced by a corporate entity for purpose of using it within the organization. In-house software however may later become available for commercial use upon sole discretion of the developing organization. The need to develop such software may arise depending on many circumstances which maybe non-availability of the software in the market

- MSA

  - short for Micro Service Architecture
  - https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Differences-Between-Monolithic-Architecture-And-Microservices-What-Is-Microservices-edureka-3.png

- on-premises

  - on-premises란 소프트웨어 등 솔루션을 클라우드 같이 원격 환경이 아닌 자체적으로 보유한 전산실 서버에 직접 설치해 운영하는 방식을 말합니다. 온프레미스는 클라우드 컴퓨팅 기술이 나오기 전까지 기업 인프라 구축의 일반적인 방식이었기 때문에 이전 또는 전통적인 단어와 함께 사용됩니다.
    일반적으로 온프레미스 시스템을 구축하는데 시간이 수개월 이상 걸렸고 비용 또한 많이 들어, 퍼블릭 클라우드가 나올 당시만 해도 온프레미스 환경이 금방이라도 모두 사라질 것 같았습니다. 하지만 보안적인 이유로 비즈니스에 중요하고 보안이 필요한 서비스와 데이터는 온프레미스 환경에서, 덜 중요한 것은 퍼블릭 클라우드 환경을 사용하는 하이브리드 IT 인프라가 대세를 이루고 있다.
