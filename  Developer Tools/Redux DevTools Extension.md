## Redux DevTools Extension

http://extension.remotedev.io

There has always been a bit of a pain in the butt under circumstances where I was developing a React-Redux integrated application: there was **no way to check whether the states** managed by the store were being correctly passed around.

This was a problem that was both time and energy consuming as I had to repeatedly write 
`console.log('someStates or dispatches from the store')` 
and check the developer console just to see if the state has been correctly changed after a dispatch that triggers update to that particular state as to my expectation in a react-redux application.

However, now that I have discovered this extremely helpful extension, it will save a lot of unneccessary console.log, just to know if the states are changing accordingly as expected.
